      <h2>Edinburgh Castle</h2>
	  <p>Perched dramatically atop Castle Rock, an extinct volcanic plug, Edinburgh Castle has dominated the city's skyline for centuries. This iconic fortress, situated at the top of the historic Royal Mile, has served as a royal residence, military stronghold, and national monument, witnessing pivotal moments in Scotland's history. Its rich heritage includes the Crown Jewels, the Stone of Destiny, and the daily firing of the One o'Clock Gun. Visitors can walk through history in its halls, learn about medieval sieges and monarchs, and enjoy sweeping views of the city below.</p>

      <h2>Palace of Holyroodhouse</h2>
	  <p>At the foot of the Royal Mile, the Palace of Holyroodhouse is the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland and a living piece of royal history. Originally founded as a monastery in 1128, the palace evolved into a principal royal residence. Visitors can tour the grand State Apartments, where the monarch conducts official duties, as well as the 16th-century apartments of Mary, Queen of Scots — including the room where her private secretary David Rizzio was brutally murdered. The romantic ruins of Holyrood Abbey next door add a gothic charm to the grounds. With elegant furnishings, art from the Royal Collection, and an audio guide steeped in dramatic historical events, the palace is a must for fans of royalty and Scottish heritage.</p>

      <h2>Royal Mile</h2>
	  <p>Connecting Edinburgh Castle to Holyrood Palace, the Royal Mile is the city’s most famous thoroughfare and the historical heart of Old Town. This cobbled street, slightly over a mile long, is lined with historic buildings, secret closes (alleyways), museums, shops, pubs, and landmarks dating back hundreds of years. As you walk along it, you'll encounter attractions such as the John Knox House, the Museum of Edinburgh, and the Canongate Kirk. The street is alive with street performers, pipers, and festival activity, especially during August’s Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Every building has a story, and exploring the Mile is like stepping back in time while feeling the pulse of the modern city.</p>

      <h2>Scott Monument</h2>
	  <p>The Scott Monument is one of Edinburgh’s most distinctive landmarks, honoring the famous Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott. Standing 200 feet tall in Princes Street Gardens, the monument is a gothic masterpiece, designed by architect George Meikle Kemp. The structure is adorned with statues of Scott’s characters, and visitors can climb the narrow spiral staircase to the top for breathtaking views of the city and beyond. The monument’s design, with its spires and intricate detailing, captures the romantic and dramatic essence of Scott’s novels, making it a must-see for literature lovers and history buffs. Nearby, you can also explore the Writers' Museum, dedicated to Scott, Robert Burns, and Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

      <h2>Calton Hill</h2>
	  <p>A favorite viewpoint for both locals and visitors, Calton Hill offers some of the best panoramic views of Edinburgh’s skyline — including Arthur’s Seat, the Firth of Forth, and the Old and New Towns. It’s also a cultural and architectural hotspot. The hill is home to a collection of striking monuments, including the unfinished Parthenon-inspired National Monument (earning it the nickname “Edinburgh’s Disgrace”), the Nelson Monument, and the Dugald Stewart Monument — a photographer’s dream at golden hour. Calton Hill is part of Edinburgh’s UNESCO World Heritage Site and is easily accessible from the city center, making it a peaceful yet inspiring escape above the bustling streets below.</p>
